Trails is a domain driven development framework in the spirit of 
Ruby on Rails or Naked Objects.
<p>
The trails project aims to make java enterprise application development 
radically simpler by allowing developers to focus on the domain model and 
having other portions dynamically generated.  We will leverage existing 
technologies such as Spring, Tapestry, and Hibernate rather 
than reinventing.<p/>
